DM-NCSA-9:
  description: 'Hosting an instance of the alert distribution service delivered from
    University of Washington on our test containerized application management service
    platform, running feeds from the pipeline to the distribution services. Note:
    This was informally tied to LDM-503-05, which was de-scoped to a small demonstration
    of running an instance of Kafka at NCSA, so no L1 database was needed. We believe
    this was completed in August 2018.'
DM-NET-4:
  description: Installed the Base LAN equipment in the Base Date Center and Base Office
    Building technical closets, and cabling connecting them for the Base Campus and
    Control Networks.  Tested with data volumes and access points equivalent to operational
    staffing and control servers for ATS observing. (Level 2 equivalent of Level 3
    milestone IT-725-M)
DM-NET-5:
  description: All segments of the Base - Archive Network, including La - Serena -
    Santiago - Sao Paolo - Miami/Boca Raton - Chicago - Champaign are operationally
    available at 100 Gbps line rate (effective rate is typically lower, ~ 80%).
DM-SQRE-2:
  description: Members of the integration and commissioning team are able to develop
    notebooks in nublado that are capable of the interactive data exploration that
    is suitable to their needs to support ComCam commissioning. Data is available
    via a Butler to a mounted filesystem. They are able to work effectively, though
    in some cases their user experience can be improved. They are primarily trained
    in person by bootcamps and may require extensive support via Slack. The service
    may be intermittently unavailable due to engineering work.
DM-SQRE-3:
  completed: '2020-01-30'
  description: Members of the integration and commissioning team as well as science
    pipelines developers use nublado to support their interactive data exploration
    needs relating to ComCam commissioning. They are able to work effectively though
    in some cases their user experience can be improved. Access to EFD data is easily
    available from notebooks. Data is available via Butler to a mounted filesystem.
    There is a curated library of notebooks modeling common tasks and a way to automatically
    verify that they are in working condition. Users can refer to documentation for
    answers to common problems. The service is stable and interruptions to the service
    are primarily notified well in advance and co-ordinated with the commissioning
    team to minimise disruption to the extent that the underlying infratsructure permits
    it
DM-SQRE-4:
  description: Science pipeline developers and members of the verification and validation
    science team use nublado to support their interactive data exploration needs relating
    to comcam commissioning. They are able to work effectively though in some cases
    their user experience can be improved. As well as access to EFD, catalogue and
    pixel data, they have access to any available APIs to the workflow/batch system
    for non-trivial data processing.  There are curated libraries of continuously
    integrated notebooks modeling common tasks and they is a reasonable workflow to
    allow Github-based collaboration on those notebooks. Users can refer to documentation
    for how to get started and for answers to common problems. The service is stable
    with minimal interruptions, but may not always scale well to large number of users.
DM-SQRE-5:
  description: Members of the science collaborations or other non-project staff with
    access to data use nublado to support their interactive scientific data exploration.
    They are able to share data with each other using LSP sharing mechanisms and can
    access data without a direct filesystem mount (eg VO services, remote Butler etc).
    The service scales well to large number of users provided the infrastructure is
    sized for them. Users can primarily rely on documentation for support, and use
    a helpdesk system for questions. There is robust functionality for performing
    large distributed catalog operations and for visually exploring LSSTCam sized
    images.
DM-STAFF:
  description: "DM Management evaluate current DM staffing against project schedule\
    \ and budget. If there is a shortfall through mid-2022 (the \u201Cops gap\u201D\

DM-SUIT-5:
  description: 'Portal provides access to a collection of public-release HSC data
    processed by LSST DM, including calibrated single-epoch images, coadds, and catalogs
    (including at least an Object-like catalog).  Access is obtained via IVOA interfaces
    including TAP for catalogs and ObsTAP for image metadata.

    (NB: Still achievable post-DM-10)'
DM-SUIT-6:
  description: 'Portal provides an interface for the display of a full focal plane''s
    worth of image data from a single visit.  Access to image metadata is obtained
    via IVOA interfaces, either ObsTAP or SIAv2, with additional search capabilities
    supporting the identification of a full visit''s worth of CCD-level images.  Some
    form of preview image for the full focal plane is provided.  Ability to keep up
    with real-time image acquisition rates is not required in this milestone.

    (NB: Post-DM-10 no _specific_ search form for visit images will be provided, but
    the "constraints form" part of the (Obs)TAP query interface will permit constructing
    this query as long as the visit ID is in the ObsTAP table.  No preview image for
    the full focal plane will be available without additional work elsewhere in DM,
    but if it is made available in ObsTAP the Portal will be able to display it.)'
DM-SUIT-7:
  description: 'Portal is integrated with NCSA-provided federated-identity authentication
    and authorization system: the Portal recognizes that a user is logged in and displays
    that state, and passes the user''s identity along to LSST data services that it
    accesses.

    (NB: Still achievable post-DM-10)

    Claimed in May, based on installation on lsst-lsp-int.'
DM-SUIT-8:
  description: 'Portal is integrated with LSST-provided WebDAV or VOSpace service
    exposing the User File Workspace. Portal provides functions for saving image and
    catalog query results to the logged-in user''s workspace, with the user''s identity
    correctly applied. Portal provides functions for accessing data in the user''s
    workspace and displaying it using the Portal''s image and table visualization
    tools, as well as using data from the workspace in other Portal contexts where
    a file can be uploaded, e.g., to perform a multi-object query.

    (NB: Still achievable post-DM-10, though only with WebDAV.)'
DM-SUIT-9:
  description: 'Portal has the ability to display a spectral image, i.e., one with
    a mixed spatial and wavelength WCS, and provide appropriate coordinate and wavelength
    readouts associated with the cursor position. Ideally this would be demonstrated
    with spectral data from the LATISS instrument on the Auxiliary Telescope.

    (NB: Post-DM-10 this will not be supported on LSST resources; however by early
    2020 we expect a variety of standard spectral-image FITS WCSes will be supported
    in Firefly due to ongoing IRSA development.)'
